# Mental-Health-Survey---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Mental Health Survey dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to mental health in the workplace.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the factors affecting mental health, analyze survey responses, and identify patterns that could help improve mental health awareness and support systems. We used Python and various data analysis libraries for a comprehensive analysis.

# Tools and Technologies
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For running the analysis and visualizing results.
# Project Steps
## Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, data inconsistencies, and irrelevant columns.
Standardizing data formats for better analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summary of survey data.
Visualization of trends, patterns, and correlations using plots.
Identifying factors influencing mental health at the workplace.
# Key Insights:

Analysis of demographics and their impact on mental health.
Understanding employer support, treatment options, and stigma in the workplace.
Key Findings
Age and gender play significant roles in mental health.
Stigma and employer support significantly impact seeking treatment.
